seq_state_model_dict = {seq: [(state, model), (state2, model2), ...], seq2: [()], ...}



Pseudo Code:

models = Train_models()
for model in models:
    print trajectory, actions
    # π1 = 102 001 120
    # π2 = 001 001 120
    add them to seq_state_model_dict

print seq_state_model_dict

# re-training phase
